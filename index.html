				<h4>Drama Club</h4>

				<p>The Drama club aims to provide those with an initial interest in acting an opportunity to learn more about the art. To set up a drama club is to strengthen members’ skills of understanding and interpreting dramatic texts through reading and writing in English. In addition, it can enhance members’ English speaking and listening skills by encouraging them to play different roles in different dramatic contexts. As audience, setting up a drama club can enable students to learn English by appreciating a drama production. Members have to rehearse the drama by listening to others actors’ lines and by reading aloud their own lines. They can even create their script and interact with other members in English.</p>

					<h2>Benefits of Our Club</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>In this Basic Acting and Theatre workshop participants explore creation of an entire production, through creativity, experimentation, physical training, team work and self discovery while understanding the basics of theatre. The workshop also focuses on physical and improvisational theatre. Thus this orientation and workshop forms an important part of a participants transition into the Yours Truly style of working.</li>
						<li>This workshop process helps participant to overcome stage fright, inhibitions, push physical, mental and creative boundaries. It is an attempt to discover self and understand working in teams using methods that are basic yet fundamental in approach.</li>
						<li>The workshop focuses on ‘FUN with art’ through experiential learning with an enviornment that is highly non-judgmental and open.</li>		
						<li>Learn your lines so well that you never have to worry about them.</li>
						<li>Keep a notebook about the play, the character, the period, your moves. It'll help you remember what you have done so far – especially if you're having to rehearse in your spare time rather than all day, every day.</li>
						<li>Never go dead for a second on stage. Even if you are doing nothing, do it actively. Listen.</li>
						<li>If something goes wrong – say someone drops something – don't ignore it. Try to deal with it in character.</li>
						<li>Warm up your voice and body. Get used to the size of the auditorium; if you don't know it already, go to the worst seats in the house and have conversations with people on the stage so you get to know what kind of energy is needed to be heard.</li>

						<h3>Modelling Innovation</h3>
						<p>Lets be honest, no model or agency is going to hire you if you don’t have any modeling or fashion pieces in your portfolio. You have to start somewhere, so find some friends who are up for modeling for you and hone your skills practicing with them. When you’re just starting you’ll most likely do a lot of shoots for free, but focus on getting in as much good work as possible and it will pay off down the road. If your friends are happy with your photos, they’ll most likely show their friends and as well as put them on Facebook and other social sites, which will only help in getting you exposure.</p>

						<h3>Handle Stardum</h3>
						<p>Probably the most important thing you can do as a successful actor is not let it get to your head. In spite of what the fans have told you, you are not the almighty. You are still just a flesh and blood person and as quickly as you became a star, that is how fast it can all come crashing down on you. So many stars who are big one day are gone the next and this dose of reality is too much for them to handle. As a result, their lives are never the same, many taking to drugs and booze. So keep your head about things. Make sure you put your success into perspective.gathered monarchies.</p>

						<h3>How to sell talent</h3>
						<p>Do you know what you offer to others? If you’re a physician, for example, do you offer relief from suffering? Wellness? Referrals? Diagnostic services? Stern lectures about smoking? Medicines? Preventive care?
						All of the above, perhaps. But how do you share this with your patients in a way that they can remember it and benefit from it? Work on the exact description of what you offer and you’ll never hesitate to share it with anyone at any time. And you’ll smile while you’re sharing it because you believe in it so much.
						The phrasing makes it even more real for you and the client. It becomes a meme.</p>
